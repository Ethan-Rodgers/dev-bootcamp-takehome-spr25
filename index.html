                <h2>Bits of Good Development Bootcamp Applicant</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Ethan Rodgers, a freshman and a Computer Science major from Decatur, Georgia. I love any and all code, and my main coding project is the free, publicly available AI-powered language-learning website <a href="https://tongueoffire.net">tongueoffire.net</a>. In my free time, I love to study foreign languages like Chinese and French and play bass guitar in rock bands. In my leadership experiences in Scouting America and with my school's Middle School Coding Club, I've discovered my passion for working with and leading younger people.</p>
                <p>My programming/computing goals for my time at Tech are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn as many industry-relevant languages and technologies as I can</li>
                    <li>Participate in computing research</li>
                    <li>Work an internship related to computing</li>
                    <li>Produce a large-scale project with a team</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Bits of Code Developer Bootcamp (hopefully followed by a position as a developer) would help me achive all of those goals, either by gaining skills or proving my skills to the community, all while contributing to tangible products for real nonprofits and those they serve. That's why I'm so excited to get started.</p>
